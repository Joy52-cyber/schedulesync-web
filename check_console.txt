IMPORTANT: How to Check Browser Console
========================================

1. Open https://schedulesync-web-production.up.railway.app in your browser

2. Press F12 (or Ctrl+Shift+I on Windows, Cmd+Option+I on Mac)

3. You'll see a panel open at the bottom or side - this is DevTools

4. Click the "Console" tab (not Elements, not Network)

5. Look for:
   ✅ Blue/black messages (normal logs)
   ❌ RED messages (errors) 
   ⚠️ Yellow messages (warnings)

6. The console should show:
   - [Dashboard] Component mounted...
   - OR red error messages
   
7. If you see NOTHING at all (completely empty console):
   - Click the filter icon (looks like a funnel)
   - Make sure all message types are enabled
   - Refresh the page (Ctrl+R)

What to share with me:
======================
- Take a screenshot of the Console tab
- Or copy ALL text from the Console (right-click → "Save as...")
- Tell me if it's completely empty or has messages
